Last Updated: September 13, 2025
Thank you for using NCHETA ("the App"), developed by Uzostudio. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information about you when you use our mobile application.
1. Information We Collect
   We collect information in the following ways:
   A. Information You Provide to Us
   Account Information: When you create an account, we collect your email address and password. If you sign up using Google or Apple, we receive your name and email address from them.
   User Content: This is the core of our service. We collect the content you provide for processing, which includes:
   Text you type or paste.
   Content from documents you upload (.txt, .pdf, .docx).
   Images you upload from your gallery or capture with your camera for text extraction (OCR).
   Audio you record using the voice-to-text feature.
   B. Information Collected Automatically
   Purchase Information: If you subscribe to a premium plan, we receive transaction confirmation and subscription status from RevenueCat and the respective app store (Google Play Store or Apple App Store). We do not collect or store your payment card details.
2. How We Use Your Information
   We use the information we collect to:
   Provide and maintain the service: Your User Content (text, documents, images, audio) is sent to the Google Gemini AI API to generate summaries, flashcards, multiple-choice questions, or to perform text extraction (OCR) and audio transcription.
   Manage your account: We use your account information to authenticate you and manage your profile.
   Provide premium features: For premium subscribers, we use your account information to enable cloud synchronization of your saved entries via Google's Firebase Firestore.
   Process transactions: We use subscription status from RevenueCat to manage your access to premium features.
   Improve the app: We may use anonymized data to understand how our app is used and to improve its functionality.
3. How We Share Your Information
   We do not sell your personal data. We only share information with the following third-party services as necessary to provide the app's functionality:
   Google (Gemini API & Firebase): Your User Content is sent to the Google Gemini AI API for processing. Your account information and (if you are a premium user) your saved entries are stored securely on Google's Firebase platform.
   RevenueCat: We share purchase tokens with RevenueCat to validate and manage your subscription status across platforms.
   We may also disclose your information if required by law or to protect our rights.
4. Data Storage and Security
   Local Storage: For all users, your saved entries are stored locally on your device in a private database.
   Cloud Storage (Premium Users): For premium subscribers, your saved entries are also stored securely in Firebase Firestore, linked to your user account, to enable cross-device sync.
   Security: We take reasonable measures to protect your information, but no security system is impenetrable.
5. Your Rights
   You have the right to access and delete your data. You can delete your saved entries directly within the app. To delete your account and all associated data, please contact us.
6. Children's Privacy
   Our service is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
   We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy in the app and updating the "Last Updated" date.
